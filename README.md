# Integrated design project
## Task
In the integrated design project (IDP) students work in teams of 6/7 to develop an autonomous robotic system to solve a problem inspired by a real-world challenge. Teams develop hardware, electronics and sensing and the accompanying control and software systems. Over 4 weeks teams develop a robot and at the end of the project there is a competition to assess the performance of the robots developed.
